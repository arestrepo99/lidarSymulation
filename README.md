# 2D LIDAR Simulation with Deep Learning Denoising

A comprehensive simulation of a 2D LIDAR system with integrated deep learning-based denoising capabilities. This project combines C-based LIDAR simulation with PyTorch-powered neural networks for real-time noise reduction in LIDAR data.

## üìã Overview

This project implements:
- **2D LIDAR Simulation**: Realistic LIDAR data generation written in C
- **Deep Learning Denoising**: Neural network models for noise reduction  
- **Temporal Processing**: LSTM-based models that leverage historical data
- **Real-time Visualization**: SDL2-based rendering of LIDAR scans

The denoising approach is inspired by the research paper: ["A Novel Lidar Signal Denoising Method Based on Convolutional Autoencoding Deep Learning Neural Network"](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/12/11/1403) from Atmosphere MDPI journal.
