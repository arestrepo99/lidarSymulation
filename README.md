# 2D LIDAR Simulation with Deep Learning Denoising

A comprehensive simulation of a 2D LIDAR system with integrated deep learning-based denoising capabilities. This project combines C-based LIDAR simulation with PyTorch-powered neural networks for real-time noise reduction in LIDAR data.

### üìã Overview

This project implements:

2D LIDAR Simulation: Realistic LIDAR data generation written in C
Deep Learning Denoising: Neural network models for noise reduction
Temporal Processing: LSTM-based models that leverage historical data
Real-time Visualization: SDL2-based rendering of LIDAR scans
The denoising approach is inspired by the research paper: "A Novel Lidar Signal Denoising Method Based on Convolutional Autoencoding Deep Learning Neural Network" from Atmosphere MDPI journal.
